# SafeStroke Booking System - DATE/TIME LOADING FIXES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Time Slots Not Loading**
**Problem**: When users tried to book, no dates and times were showing up in the calendar.

**Root Causes**:
- Database likely had no time slots initialized
- Time slots were created starting October 5, 2025, but the system might have been looking in the wrong date range
- No automatic initialization of time slots when the system starts

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added automatic time slot initialization when the booking system loads
- Improved error handling to show detailed error messages when time slots can't be loaded
- Added "Initialize Time Slots" button as fallback for users
- Enhanced debugging and logging in the get-time-slots function

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
**Problem**: Users saw generic "failed to load" messages without helpful details.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added detailed error messages showing exactly what went wrong
- Added debugging information in browser console for troubleshooting
- Added retry mechanisms for time slot loading
- Added visual feedback for different error states

### 3. **Calendar Date Range Issues**
**Problem**: Calendar was looking for time slots in wrong month/date ranges.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed month parameter formatting in API calls
- Improved date range calculations
- Added logging to verify correct date ranges are being requested

## Files Modified

1. **booking-system-v2.js** → **booking-system-v2.js** (replaced)
   - Added `initializeTimeSlotsIfNeeded()` function
   - Enhanced `loadTimeSlots()` with better error handling
   - Added debugging and automatic retry logic
   - Original backed up as `booking-system-v2-BACKUP.js`

2. **netlify/functions/get-time-slots.js** → **get-time-slots.js** (replaced)
   - Added extensive logging for debugging
   - Improved error messages
   - Better handling of date ranges
   - Original backed up as `get-time-slots-BACKUP.js`

## What Happens Now

### Automatic Fixes:
1. **Time Slot Initialization**: When someone visits the booking page, the system will automatically check if time slots exist for October 2025. If not, it will create them automatically.

2. **Better Error Messages**: If there are still issues, users will see helpful error messages explaining what's wrong and offering solutions.

3. **Manual Override**: Users can click "Initialize Time Slots" button if automatic initialization fails.

### For Testing:
1. **Go to your booking page**: Visit safestroke-booking.html
2. **Try booking with a package code**: Enter an existing package code and see if times load
3. **Check browser console**: Press F12 and look at console for debugging information
4. **Try different programs**: Test Droplet, Splashlet, and Strokelet to ensure all work

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Page Load**: System automatically checks for time slots and creates them if needed
2. **Calendar Display**: October 2025 calendar shows available times on Sundays and Mondays
3. **Time Selection**: Clicking on available dates shows specific time slots
4. **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong, clear error messages guide the user

## If Issues Persist

The fixes include extensive logging. If problems continue:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab) for detailed error messages
2. **Look for these log messages**:
   - "=== TIME SLOTS RESPONSE ===" shows what the API returned
   - "=== GET TIME SLOTS REQUEST ===" shows what the API received
   - Error messages will show specific database or network issues

3. **Manual Database Check**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Check the `time_slots` table
   - Ensure there are entries with `lesson_type` matching your programs
   - Verify `status` is set to 'available'
   - Check that `current_enrollment` < `max_capacity`

## Backup Information

If you need to revert to the original files:
- **booking-system-v2-BACKUP.js** → rename to **booking-system-v2.js**
- **netlify/functions/get-time-slots-BACKUP.js** → rename to **get-time-slots.js**

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to your live site
2. **Test the booking flow** with a real package code
3. **Monitor the browser console** for any remaining issues
4. **Check that time slots are being created** in your database

The booking system should now properly load dates and times for users to book their lessons!
