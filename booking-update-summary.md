## Summary of Changes

### âœ… **Fixed Layout & Flow Separation**

The booking system now has two completely separate flows:

## 1. **Single Lesson Flow**
- Select "Book a Single Lesson" from the main options
- Choose your program (Droplet $35, Splashlet $45, Strokelet $50)
- Apply promo code if available (e.g., FIRST-FREE)
- Select a time slot from the calendar
- Enter details and checkout directly

## 2. **Package Flow**  
- Select "Purchase a Package" from the main options
- Choose your program
- Select package size (4, 6, or 8 lessons)
- Complete payment
- Get package code
- Use code to book lessons

### Key Features:
- **Clear visual separation** between single lessons and packages
- **Streamlined single lesson booking** - no need to purchase a package first
- **Promo code support** for single lessons (FIRST-FREE gives 100% off)
- **Direct checkout** after selecting time for paid single lessons
- **"Book Another Lesson"** button now works correctly for packages

### Files Modified:
1. `safestroke-booking.html` - Added separated UI for single vs package selection
2. `booking-system-v2.js` - Added new flow logic and functions
3. `create-free-package.js` - Handles free single lessons with promo codes

### To Deploy:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Separate single lesson and package booking flows with improved UX"
git push origin main
```

The system now provides a much cleaner experience with distinct paths for customers who want to try a single lesson versus those ready to commit to a package.
